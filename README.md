# Polynomial Visualizer

Polynomial Visualizer is a web application that allows users to visualize polynomial functions. Users can interactively change the parameters of the polynomial and see the resulting graph update in real-time.

## Features

- Interactive user interface to adjust polynomial parameters.
- Visualization of polynomial graphs using Plotly.
- Adjustable axes ranges for better graph analysis.
- Reset functionality to quickly revert to default settings.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- jQuery UI
- Plotly.js

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- A modern web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox)
- An internet connection (for loading external libraries)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dewmguy/PolynomialVisualizer.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd PolynomialVisualizer
   ```

3. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

### Usage

1. **Order Selection**: Use the input field labeled `Order` to set the degree of the polynomial (1-6).
2. **X-axis Range**: Adjust the minimum and maximum X values using the respective input fields.
3. **Y-axis Range**: Adjust the minimum and maximum Y values using the respective input fields.
4. **Parameters**: Adjust the polynomial parameters in the dynamically generated input fields.
5. **Reset**: Click the `Reset` button to revert all settings to their default values.
6. The polynomial formula and its graph will be displayed and updated in real-time.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the web application.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file for styling the web application.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file containing the logic for interactive elements and visualization.
